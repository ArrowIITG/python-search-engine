So, lets go through this. First, we make an empty hashtable (python dictionary), and we use two nested for loops to iterate through every word in the input hash. Then, we first check if that word is present as a key in the output hashtable. If it isnâ€™t, then we add it, setting as its value another hashtable that maps the document (identified, in this case, by the variable filename) to the list of positions of that word.
