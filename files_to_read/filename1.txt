If it is a key, then we do another check: if the current document is in each wordâ€™s hashtable (the one that maps filenames to word positions). If it is, we extend the current positions list with this list of positions (note that this case is left in only for completeness: it will never be hit because each word will only have one list of positions for every filename). If it is not, then we set the positions equal to the positions list for this filename.
