The inverted index is the main data structure of our search engine. We will use a Hashtable (pythonâ€™s dictionary) to store the inverted index in memory. The reason is we will perform lots of lookups (one for every term in the document), and we will also add lots of keys (every term is a key), so we want these operations to be very efficient. Since Hashtables have average O(1) lookup time and amortized O(1) insertion time, they are very suitable for our needs.
